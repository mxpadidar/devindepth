    <p>
      Dev In Depth is a personal blog focused on backend development and the
      engineering work that sits behind real applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use this space to write about what I read, what I build, and the things
      I learn while working on APIs, services, and data-driven systems. Some
      posts are deep dives, others are notes and explanations I write to
      solidify my understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The topics usually revolve around backend architecture, performance,
      databases, reliability, and the trade-offs that come with designing and
      maintaining software in production. This is not a collection of polished
      tutorials — it’s a working notebook shaped by real problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you work on the backend, or you care about how systems behave beyond
      the happy path, you’ll likely find something useful here.
